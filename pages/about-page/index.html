            <h2>Janine A. Refugido</h2>
            <h3>19 years old / Student  / Marikina City, Philippines</h3>
            <p>I'm a passionate Web Developer and IT student with a keen interest in crafting seamless digital
               experiences and developing innovative solutions. Currently pursuing my degree in Information 
               Technology, I have honed my skills in both front-end and back-end web development through academic 
               projects and personal initiatives. My journey in the IT field began with a curiosity for how websites
               work and a desire to create engaging online experiences. I thrive in collaborative environments 
               and am always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies. In my free time, I enjoy exploring
               the latest web development trends, contributing to coding communities, and working on personal 
               projects to further enhance my skills.</p>
